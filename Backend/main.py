The platform is a web application built with TypeScript and React, designed to help young people explore and choose suitable educational paths. It features a user-friendly interface for browsing various educational programs, providing detailed information and resources to guide decision-making. My main responsibilities included API integration with multiple services such as OpenAI and Cortical.IO, as well as developing a web scraper to collect the necessary text data. Additionally, I implemented a calculation system to score subjects based on their connection to mathematics, using a mix of TypeScript and Python. The project aims to make the process of selecting an education more accessible and informed for users.",
